    ### From nginx documentation
    #If the Host header field does not match a server name, NGINX Plus routes the request to the default server
    # for the port on which the request arrived. The default server is the first one listed in the nginx.conf
    # file, unless you include the default_server parameter to the listen directive to explicitly designate
    # a server as the default.

    # "_" is a wildcard for all host names

    #$host will be replaced by whichever hostname was recived by the request
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
